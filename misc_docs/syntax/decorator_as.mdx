Use this decorator on record types to alias record names to a different JS attribute name.

This is mostly useful to map to JS attribute names that cannot be expressed in ReScript (such as keywords).

### Example

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
type action = {
  [@bs.as "type"] _type: string,
};
```

```js
var action = {
  type: "ADD_USER"
};
```
</CodeTab>

Refer to the [Records as Objects](/docs/manual/latest/bind-to-js-object#bind-using-rescript-record) section for a more detailed explanation.
