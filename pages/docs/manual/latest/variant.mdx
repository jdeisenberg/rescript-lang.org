# Variant

So far, most of ReScript's data structures might look familiar to you. This section introduces an extremely important, and perhaps unfamiliar, data structure: variant.

Most data structures in most languages are about "this **and** that". A variant allows us to express "this **or** that".

```res
type myResponse =
  | Yes
  | No
  | PrettyMuch

let areYouCrushingIt = Yes
```

`myResponse` is a variant type with the cases `Yes`, `No` and `PrettyMuch`, which are called "variant constructors" (or "variant tag"). The `|` bar separates each constructor.

**Note**: a variant's constructors need to be capitalized.

## Variant Needs an Explicit Definition

If the variant you're using is in a different file, bring it into scope like you'd do [for a record](record.md#record-needs-an-explicit-definition):

```res
// Zoo.res

type animal = Dog | Cat | Bird
```

```res
// Example.res

let pet: Zoo.animal = Dog // preferred
// or
let pet = Zoo.Dog
```

## Constructor Arguments

A variant's constructors can hold extra data separated by comma.

```res
type account =
  | None
  | Instagram(string)
  | Facebook(string, int)
```

Here, `Instagram` holds a `string`, and `Facebook` holds a `string` and an `int`. Usage:

```res
let myAccount = Facebook("Josh", 26)
let friendAccount = Instagram("Jenny")
```

### Records in Variants

You can use a record type in a variant:

```res
type idType = {name: string, password: string}

type user =
  | Number(int)
  | Id(idType)
```

If the record type is used only in the variant definition, you may put it in line:

```res
type user =
  | Number(int)
  | Id({name: string, password: string})
```

### Pattern Matching On Variant

See the [Pattern Matching/Destructuring](pattern-matching-destructuring.md) section later.

## Tips & Tricks

**Be careful** not to confuse a constructor carrying 2 arguments with a constructor carrying a single tuple argument:

```res
type account =
  | Facebook(string, int) // 2 arguments
type account2 =
  | Instagram((string, int)) // 1 argument - happens to be a 2-tuple
```
### Variants Must Have Constructors

If you come from an untyped language, you might be tempted to try `type foo = int | string`. This isn't possible in ReScript; you'd have to give each branch a constructor: `type foo = Int(int) | String(string)`. The former looks nice, but causes lots of trouble down the line.

### Interop with JavaScript

_This section assumes knowledge about our [FFI](/docs/reason-compiler/latest/interop-overview). Skip this if you haven't felt the itch to use variants for wrapping JS functions yet_.

Quite a few JS libraries use functions that can accept many types of arguments. In these cases, it's very tempting to model them as variants. For example, suppose there's a `myLibrary.draw` JS function that takes in either a `number` or a `string`. You might be tempted to bind it like so:

```res
// reserved for internal usage
@bs.module("myLibrary") external draw : 'a => unit = "draw"

type animal =
  | MyFloat(float)
  | MyString(string)

let betterDraw = (animal) =>
  switch animal {
  | MyFloat(f) => draw(f)
  | MyString(s) => draw(s)
  }
```

You could definitely do that, but there are better ways! For example, define two `external`s that both compile to the same JS call:

```res
@bs.module("myLibrary") external drawFloat: float => unit = "draw"
@bs.module("myLibrary") external drawString: string => unit = "draw"
```

ReScript also provides [a few other ways](bind-to-js-function.md#modeling-polymorphic-function) to do this.

### Variant Types Are Found By Field Name

Please refer to this [record section](record#record-types-are-found-by-field-name). Variants are the same: a function can't accept an arbitrary constructor shared by two different variants. Again, such feature exists; it's called a polymorphic variant. We'll talk about this in the future =).

## Design Decisions

Variants, in their many forms (polymorphic variant, open variant, GADT, etc.), are likely _the_ feature of a type system such as ReScript's. The aforementioned `option` variant, for example, obliterates the need for nullable types, a major source of bugs in other languages. Philosophically speaking, a problem is composed of many possible branches/conditions. Mishandling these conditions is the majority of what we call bugs. **A type system doesn't magically eliminate bugs; it points out the unhandled conditions and asks you to cover them**\*. The ability to model "this or that" correctly is crucial.

For example, some folks wonder how the type system can safely eliminate badly formatted JSON data from propagating into their program. They don't, not by themselves! But if the parser returns the `option` type `None | Some(actualData)`, then you'd have to handle the `None` case explicitly in later call sites. That's all there is.

Performance-wise, a variant can potentially tremendously speed up your program's logic. Here's a piece of JavaScript:

```js
let data = 'dog'
if (data === 'dog') {
  ...
} else if (data === 'cat') {
  ...
} else if (data === 'bird') {
  ...
}
```

There's a linear amount of branch checking here (`O(n)`). Compare this to using a ReScript variant:

```res
type animal = Dog | Cat | Bird
let data = Dog
switch data {
| Dog => ...
| Cat => ...
| Bird => ...
}
```

The compiler sees the variant, then

1. conceptually turns them into `type animal = 0 | 1 | 2`
2. compiles `switch` to a constant-time jump table (`O(1)`).
